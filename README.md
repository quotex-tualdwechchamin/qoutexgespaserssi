### Why is account verification necessary?

Account verification is an important step for any online trading
platform. It helps to protect both the trader and the platform from
fraud and money laundering. By verifying your account, you\'re
confirming that you are who you say you are and that you are not using
the platform for illegal activities.

### How long does the verification process take?

The verification process typically takes 1-3 business days. However, it
may take longer if there is a high volume of requests or if your
documents are not clear or complete.

    card)

    statement)
